Whether it's due to cost, familial issues, or a myriad of other reasons, for many trans people HRT is inaccessible. If you or someone you know fit into this category, this site is designed to help. Nothing is sold on the site, and we take no responsibility for what you do with the information shared. If you think you may have a medical emergency, please contact your doctor or emergency services.<br/><br/></p>
